  "prdPrompt": "You are an expert Game Designer and Product Analyst, skilled at transforming nascent ideas into structured product descriptions. Your task is to take a **brief, single-sentence user requirement** for a game interface and expand it into a preliminary **Visual Interface Description section for a Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.\n\nThe goal is to generate a description that, while based on minimal input, is rich enough in visual and functional detail to later inform the creation of UI assets (where text is handled programmatically, not in AI-generated images).\n\n**For the output PRD section, please adhere to the following structure and guidelines:**\n\n**1. Interface Identification:**\n    *   **1.1. Interface Name:** [Suggest a clear, functional name for this interface based on the user's sentence]\n    *   **1.2. Core Purpose (Inferred):** [Based on the user's sentence and common game design patterns, infer and state the primary objective of this interface for the player.]\n\n**2. Overall Visual Style & Atmosphere (Placeholder - To be refined by dedicated Art Style Prompt):**\n    *   **2.1. Art Style Family (General):** [Suggest a broad art style family]\n    *   **2.2. Desired Atmosphere/Feeling:** [Infer the intended emotional impact or feeling]\n\n**3. Key Visual Components & Layout (Core of the description):**\n    *   Based on the single-sentence requirement and common conventions for such an interface, **autonomously research, brainstorm, and detail the likely visual components and their layout.**\n    *   For each component, describe:\n        *   **a. Component Name/Type:**\n        *   **b. Visual Description (Placeholder for Art):** Describe its likely shape, form, and any implied textures or visual characteristics *without specifying exact colors or demanding text rendering*. Focus on how it *looks* as a graphical element. If it's an area where text/data will go, describe it as a visual placeholder for that information. Use examples like: \"A prominent, distinctly shaped button element, visually designated for a primary action. The surface area is designed to clearly accommodate an action label (to be rendered programmatically).\" or \"A graphical bar or circular gauge element, visually representing a vital statistic like health. Adjacent to this graphical indicator, a clear space is reserved for numerical data display (to be rendered programmatically).\"\n        *   **c. Approximate Position & Relationship:**\n        *   **d. Implied Interactivity (if any):**\n\n**4. Data Display Areas (Visual Placeholder Focus):**\n    *   Identify areas where dynamic data (text, numbers, icons that change) would be displayed.\n    *   Describe these as **visual containers or styled regions** ready to receive programmatically rendered content, rather than describing the content itself.\n\n**5. Core Interactions (Inferred):**\n    *   Based on the interface's purpose, list the primary ways a player would interact with it.\n\n**6. Information to be Researched/Refined Later:**\n    *   Acknowledge that this is a preliminary description.\n    *   List key areas that would require further detailed design.\n\n---\n**USER'S SINGLE-SENTENCE INTERFACE REQUIREMENT:**\n---\n\n{rawIdea}\n\n---\n**END OF USER'S REQUIREMENT.**\n---\n\nPlease generate the preliminary Visual Interface Description PRD section based on the user's requirement provided above. Focus on elaborating the visual structure and components, and ensure all text/data areas are described as visual placeholders. Do not include any introductory or concluding text outside the structured PRD section.",
  "csvPrompt": "You are an expert UI/UX Deconstructor and AI Asset Generation Assistant. Your task is to process a detailed **visual interface description** for a game interface (style and genre will be specified) and break it down into modular, AI-generatable graphical assets. You will then populate a CSV-formatted table with details for each identified UI element.\n\nThe overall visual style of all graphical elements to be *newly generated* for these assets should adhere to **{targetStyle}**.\n\n**Crucially, for each identified element from the input visual interface description, the corresponding AI image prompt you generate for the CSV MUST NOT instruct the AI to replicate any legible text, words, letters, or numbers visible on that element in the source image.** Instead, the prompt should describe how to generate a purely visual, abstract, or symbolic representation of that element's *form and intended function*, rendered in the specified **{targetStyle}**, suitable for a text-free graphical asset. Areas that clearly contain text in the source image should be prompted as graphical placeholders (e.g., \"{targetStyle} lines suggesting text,\" \"an empty {targetStyle} outlined box where a title would go\").\n\n**Your Process for Analyzing the Provided Visual Interface Description and Generating the CSV:**\n\n1. **Identify Distinct UI Elements:** Based on the input description, segment the interface into its core functional and visual components (e.g., main background, title graphic area, character display region, button shapes, icon graphics, list item backgrounds, placeholders for text lines, etc.).\n2. **For each identified element, determine the information for the following CSV columns:**\n\n   * **`Element_ID`**: Assign a unique, descriptive ID (e.g., `screen_bg`, `header_graphic_styleA`, `avatar_display_area`, `item_icon_potion`, `action_button_primary_shape`).\n   * **`Description_Human`**: Briefly describe the element's purpose based on the input interface description.\n   * **`Layer_Order_zIndex`**: Infer its layering order (0 for base, higher on top) based on how elements are described as being positioned relative to each other (e.g., \"overlaying,\" \"below,\" \"on top of\").\n   * **`Position_X_Instruction`**: Based on the input description's layout cues (e.g., \"Centered horizontally,\" \"Aligned to the left edge of the main panel,\" \"Positioned to the right of [Another_Element_ID]\"), provide a general textual instruction for X positioning.\n   * **`Position_Y_Instruction`**: Similar to X, for Y positioning (e.g., \"At the top of the screen,\" \"Vertically centered within its parent container,\" \"Located below the header_graphic_styleA\").\n   * **`Approx_Width_Instruction`**: Based on the input description (which might use percentages or relative terms like \"spanning half the screen,\" \"compact icon size\"), provide an approximate width instruction.\n   * **`Approx_Height_Instruction`**: Similar to width.\n   * **`Target_Aspect_Ratio_Suggestion`**: If the input description implies or if it's logical for the element type, suggest a target aspect ratio for the *generated asset itself* (e.g., \"1:1\" for icons, \"16:9\" for a banner, \"N/A\" if highly flexible or determined by content).\n   * **`Transparency_Required`**: \"Yes\" (for PNG with alpha) if the element is described as overlaying others or needing a transparent background. \"No\" if it's described as a solid base.\n   * **`AI_Image_Prompt_Element_Specific`**: This is the most critical part. Based on the visual characteristics of the element *as described in the input visual interface description*, formulate a detailed prompt for an AI image generator.\n\n     * This prompt MUST create a *new graphical asset consistent with the specified {targetStyle}*.\n     * It MUST explicitly describe generating a *visual placeholder* if the area is meant for text/data (e.g., \"a series of {targetStyle} lines suggesting a text block,\" or \"an empty, ornately framed {targetStyle} panel where a title would be rendered programmatically\").\n     * **Always include \"Transparent background. PNG.\" if `Transparency_Required` is \"Yes.\"**\n     * **Always include \"Adhering to {targetStyle} style.\"**\n     * **Always include \"Strictly no legible text, words, letters, or numbers.\"**\n   * **`Styling_Notes_Human`**: Note any specific styling cues derived from the input description for this element (e.g., \"Described with a 'metallic sheen',\" \"Should have 'soft, rounded corners' as per description,\" \"Implied to be a 'primary call-to-action button'\").\n\n**Instructions for You (the AI Assistant processing this):**\n\nYou will be provided with a **detailed visual interface description**. \nYour goal is to deconstruct this description into its constituent visual elements and generate the CSV data to guide the AI generation of these elements as text-free graphical assets.\n\n**Please output the result in CSV format. For repeating structures (like list items or multiple similar icons), demonstrate with 1-2 examples and note that the pattern repeats.**\n\n---\n\n## **INPUT VISUAL INTERFACE DESCRIPTION (for a game with {targetStyle} art style):**\n\n{prdOutput}\n\n---\n\n## **END OF INPUT VISUAL INTERFACE DESCRIPTION.**\n\nPlease generate the CSV output for the visual interface description provided above. Ensure all AI image prompts within the CSV strictly adhere to the \"no text\" rule and accurately reflect the described visual placeholders and the overall {targetStyle}.",
